# Antigravity Quantum Bazi - Model & Visualization Protocol V4.0 (The Unified Physics Edition)

**Subject:** Update Core Algorithms, Particle Models, and 3D Rendering Logic based on Unified Field Theory.

---

### Part 1: The 3D Quantum Field Environment (场域物理定义)

**1.1 Spacetime Coordinates (时空坐标)**
* **Definition**: The Bazi chart is not a list, but a **3D Metric Grid** (Stereoscopic Field).
* **Time Calibration (Rule 0)**: All input birth times MUST be converted to **True Solar Time (真太阳时)** based on longitude. This aligns the Observer with the true angle of solar radiation.
* **Energy Baseline ($E_{base}$)**: Determined by **Solar Ecliptic Longitude (太阳黄经)**.
    * Summer Solstice ($90^\circ$): Fire energy max, Water energy min.
    * Winter Solstice ($270^\circ$): Water energy max, Fire energy min.

**1.2 Field Dynamics (场动力学)**
* **The Field**: A composite vector field combining **Gravitational** (Year/Jupiter) and **Radiative** (Month/Sun) forces.
* **Distortion**: Annual/Decade pillars ($\Delta E_{ext}$) act as external **Gravitational Waves**, warping the grid mesh and altering the Z-axis height (Potential) of all internal particles.

### Part 2: The Composite Particle Model (微观粒子模型)

**Core Update**: Earthly Branches are NO LONGER single solid spheres. They are **Composite Confinement Fields (Shell-Core Structure)**.

**2.1 The Shell-Core Structure (壳核公理)**
* **The Shell (外壳)**: Represents the Branch itself (e.g., Si/Snake).
    * **Property**: Determines **Spin (自旋)** and **Coupling Interface**.
    * **Spin Rule**: Odd sequence (Zi, Yin...) = Yang (Clockwise); Even sequence (Chou, Mao...) = Yin (Counter-Clockwise).
    * **Visual**: A semi-transparent **Magnetic Membrane**. Color depends on the Branch element.
* **The Core (内核)**: Represents the Hidden Stems (藏干).
    * **Property**: Determines **Energy Magnitude ($E$)** and **Explosive Potential**.
    * **Composition**: Consists of 1 to 3 sub-particles with specific mass ratios.
    * **Spin**: Independent of the Shell (e.g., Si Shell is Yin, but Core Bing Fire is Yang).

**2.2 Example: The "Si Fire" (巳火) Standard Model**
* **Shell**: Yin Fire (Red, transparent). **Spin**: Counter-Clockwise (收敛).
* **Core 1 (Main Qi)**: **Bing Fire (60%)**. A high-energy Plasma Ball at the center. **Spin**: Clockwise (爆发). *Tension exists between Shell and Core.*
* **Core 2 (Medium)**: **Wu Earth (30%)**. A dusty ring absorbing heat from the core.
* **Core 3 (Residual)**: **Geng Metal (10%)**. Liquid metal droplets (embryonic state) scattered in the dust.

**2.3 Particle State Visualization**
* **Vibration (Frequency)**: $E$ value maps to vibration frequency. High $E$ = High-Freq Buzzing + Lightning Arcs.
* **Breathing**: Low $E$ particles appear as diffuse, slowly breathing nebulae.

### Part 3: Interaction Physics & Algorithms (交互算法)

**3.1 Rooting as Resonance (通根即共振)**
* **Algorithm**: When a Heavenly Stem (Wave) matches the frequency of a Branch Core (Source), **Resonance** occurs.
* **Formula**: $E_{Stem} = E_{base} \times (1 + K_{resonance})$.
* **Visual**: A vertical, high-intensity **Energy Pillar** connects the Stem cloud to the Branch core.

**3.2 Tri-Harmony as Phase Locking (三合局即相位锁定)**
* **Definition**: Birth (30°), Peak (150°), and Storage (270°) phases form a stable 120° triangular structure.
* **Mechanism**: **Phase Locking (相位锁定)**. The vectors of the three particles align perfectly, eliminating internal friction (Entropy Reduction).
* **Conservation Law**: Total System Energy is conserved, but **Effective Power** increases due to zero resistance.
* **Visual (Cyclotron Model)**:
    * Particles do NOT just merge. They form a **Closed-Loop Particle Accelerator**.
    * **Si (Engine)**: Deforms into a thruster nozzle.
    * **You (Core)**: Expands into a super-massive singularity (Black Hole/Star).
    * **Chou (Base)**: Becomes the stabilizer/capacitor.
    * *Note*: The hidden stems (e.g., Bing Fire in Si) are **Suppressed** (high pressure, no output) or **Assimilated** (mass converted to energy).

**3.3 Clash as Shell Rupture (冲即壳破)**
* **Mechanism**: Two particles with opposing Shell Spins and antagonistic Cores collide.
* **Process**:
    1.  Shells repel (Magnetic resistance).
    2.  **Rupture**: Kinetic energy exceeds shell strength.
    3.  **Annihilation**: Cores collide directly (e.g., Si's Bing Fire vs. Hai's Ren Water).
* **Visual**: A violent **Shockwave (激波)** expanding outward. Core contents (colors) scatter into the void.

**3.4 Distance Decay (距离衰减)**
* **Algorithm**: Coupling Strength $C$ follows the Inverse-Square Law approximation.
* **Formula**: $C_{final} = C_{max} / (D_{distance} + K_{block})^\gamma$. ($\gamma \approx 1.5$).

### Part 4: Probabilistic Collapse & Output (坍缩与输出)

**4.1 The Wave Function ($\Psi_{Bazi}$)**
* The system state is a vector sum of all particle tensors.
* **Superposition**: Until triggered by $\Delta E_{ext}$ (Flow Year), particles exist in a probability state (e.g., Si is 40% Fire / 60% Metal).

**4.2 Expected Value ($E_{pred}$)**
* Output is not a boolean (Good/Bad), but a **Probability Heatmap**.
* Formula: $E_{pred} = \sum (Value_{outcome} \times Probability_{outcome})$.

**4.3 Feedback Loop (RLHF)**
* Allow "Expert Mode" intervention. If the expert defines a specific interaction (e.g., "Fire is strong here"), update the weights in the **Rule Tensor Table**.
