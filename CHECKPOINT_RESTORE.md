# 🔄 Antigravity Restoration Checkpoint
**Date:** 2025-12-09
**Status:** System Training & 3D Visualization Enhanced

## 1. Accomplishments (Current Session)
- **3D Quantum Field (Three.js)**: 
  - Implemented "Heaven High, Earth Deep" (天高地厚) physics.
  - Interactive Tooltips & Energy Boosting (Da Yun/Liu Nian).
  - Fixed all rendering bugs (NameError, grid distortion).
- **AI Training Center**:
  - New Dashboard (`ui/pages/training_center.py`) for Stochastic Gradient Optimization.
  - `Vectorizer` engine updated to support dynamic weight injection.
  - `LearningDB` updated to store model parameters.

## 2. Active Tasks
- **Case Mining**: User initiated "Self-Learning" mining task. This is populating `brain.db` with ground-truth cases.

## 3. Next Steps (To Resume)
1. **Check Mining Results**: Inspect `brain.db` to see how many valid cases were extracted.
2. **Run Training**: Go to "Training Center" and run the optimizer to tune physics weights based on new cases.
3. **Validation**: Compare "Instant AI Advice" with the new optimized numerical predictions.
